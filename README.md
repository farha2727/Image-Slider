In this project, I created an image slider with diverse functionalities. The final product is an image slider that automatically shifts every five seconds. There are two buttons, a previous and a next button. The buttons enable users to navigate through the images manually. The slider is visually appealing, featuring a stunning box shadow and icons sourced from Font Awesome. I created the HTML structure, followed by styling the slider with CSS, and finally, added functionality to the project using JavaScript. This project taught me how to create an image slider from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, including navigation buttons, automatic image transitioning, and the incorporation of attractive design elements.
